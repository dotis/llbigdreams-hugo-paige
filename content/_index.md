# Welcome

In the fall of 2002, Cobleskill lost a young entrepreneur and spark plug of the community in an unfortunate accident. 
Many of Michael Law’s friends and family have pulled together to create an organization to honor his spirit and memory.

Each year, hundreds gather for a fun-filled weekend of golf and friendship. 
Now in its 21st year, the Stumpy Cup raises money for a scholarship fund in Michael's name and provides a weekend of reconnecting with family and friends.
 
To date, nearly $42,000 has been donated to support local efforts. 
All proceeds from the Stumpy Cup go to an endowed scholarship fund in Michael's name at SUNY Cobleskill.

This year's tournament will be held in Cobleskill, NY on July 20th, 2024.
